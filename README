TODO: add support for deleting users

Note: this plugin requires my fork of python-espeak to properly display the list of available languages
Don't be surprised if you get an exception when you try to do "/ircspeak langlist"

/help ircspeak

Setting a new user:
/ircspeak set --help

Saving your options:
/ircspeak save

Get a list of all available languages:
/ircspeak langlist
